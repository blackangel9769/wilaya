## Test Questions

### Frontend Questions

1.  **Explain how you would improve the user interface of the application.** (Difficulty: Easy)

- Discuss potential enhancements in design, usability, and accessibility.

- **Answer**: 1. understand the user needs and tailor the interface to it
   2. try to make the interface as user friendly as possible and simplify the navigation 
   3. remove unnecessary elements that may confuse the user 
   4. make the experience as enjoyable as possible using interactive elements and animation



2.  **Describe how you would implement a feature to export the list of selected wilayas and communes to a CSV file.** (Difficulty: Medium)

- Outline the steps and technologies you would use.

- **Answer**: I have the id and the name of city so ill use the javascript built in tools 
   code example
//create a function to export the cvs 
function exporttocvs
{
// define the array list
const city [
["id","name","commun"]
["1","setif","setif"]
["2","oran","aounturk"]
["3","alg","harach"]
["4","msila","ainlahjel"]
];
//convereteing to cvs format 

const csvContent = cities.map(row => row.join(",")).join("\n");

// create a Blob (Binary Large Object) that's used in js to represent raw data

const blob = new Blob([csvContent], { type: "text/csv" });

// create a download link for the cvs file 

const link = document.createElement("cvs");
    link.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    link.download = "cities.csv";
    document.body.appendChild(link);

// make the trigger for the download and the cleanup 

   link.click();
    document.body.removeChild(link);
}
// the function call 

exportCitiesToCSV();



3.  **What are the benefits of using Selectize and SweetAlert in this application?** (Difficulty: Easy)

- Explain how these libraries enhance the user experience.

- **Answer**:electize :
simplify the search and selection process for the user plus it Allows users to select multiple options with an intuitive interface and if enabled it can help the user create entries and items on the fly

sweatalert:
More visually appealing than default browser alerts and less  intrusive plus it Waits for user confirmation before proceeding making it useful for deletions or critical actions


4.  **How would you ensure the application is responsive across different devices?** (Difficulty: Medium)

- Discuss techniques and tools you would use to achieve responsiveness.

- **Answer**:1 Use TailwindCSS for Responsive Design 
             2 Make Selectiz Dropdowns and SweetAlert popup Mobile-Friendly

### Backend Questions

1.  **How would you secure the API endpoints to prevent unauthorized access?** (Difficulty: Medium)

- Discuss methods such as authentication and authorization.

- **Answer**:I would use authentication using technologies such as openid and 0auth or jwt to dictate who can have access and to what exactly 
jwt : is where the server issues a signed token (JWT) after login.
openid &0auth : is secure token-based authentication used by Google, Facebook, etc. 
now as for the log in it self we can use a role based system eg (json : "admin": { "canRead": true, "canWrite": true }  ) 



2.  **Explain how you would optimize the database queries to improve performance.** (Difficulty: Hard)

- Provide examples of indexing or query optimization techniques.

- **Answer**: ...

3.  **Describe how you would implement logging for API requests and errors.** (Difficulty: Medium)

- Discuss the tools and strategies you would use for logging and monitoring.

- **Answer**:in sql databses Instead of manually checking inputs use validation libraries such as express validator and for NoSQL databases like MongoDB, use Mongoose schema validation.
and instead of handling errors in each route separately you can use a global error handler.

4.  **How would you handle data validation and error handling in the backend?** (Difficulty: Medium)

- Explain the strategies you would use to ensure data integrity and error management.

- **Answer**: ...

- Describe the initial setup steps, including environment configuration and package installation.

- **Answer**:the init
first creat the app 
npx create-react-app wilaya-app
then cd toit 
cd wilaya-app
then installing the packs 
npm install axios   install Selectize   install sweetalert2   
then make the env
 REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

2.  **Explain how you would manage state in a React application for this project.** (Difficulty: Medium)

- Discuss the use of hooks or state management libraries.

- **Answer**:tools used react hooks 
   Step 1: Create a Context (WilayaContext.js)
   Step 2: Use Context in Components (WilayaSelector.js)
